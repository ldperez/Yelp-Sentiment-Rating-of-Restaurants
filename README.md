# Yelp-Sentiment-Rating-of-Restaurants

**Project Intro/Objective**

The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and customers have access to a vast array of dining options.While online review platforms such as Yelp provide ratings and reviews of restaurants, they are often subjective and may not accurately reflect customers' overall sentiment. Moreover, traditional rating systems do not consider the nuances of customers' experiences or preferences. As a result, customers may need help making informed dining decisions, and restaurant operators may need help to improve their businesses based on customers' feedback
